In the intricate tapestry of justice the pursuit of  truth and the rectification of wrongs have long been arduous endeavors. Yet, on the horizon of modern  jurisprudence, a beacon  of hope emerges. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and other cutting-edge technologies  is transforming the fight against wrongful convictions, heralding a new era of equity and justice.
