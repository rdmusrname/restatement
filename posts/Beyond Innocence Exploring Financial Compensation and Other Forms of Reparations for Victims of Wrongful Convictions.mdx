Restorative justice processes prioritize healing, accountability, and community engagement. They bring together victims, offenders, and community members in facilitated  dialogues allowing for open and honest conversations about the harm that has been done and the steps that need to be taken to facilitate healing and restoration. By promoting empathy, understanding, and accountability,  restorative justice can play a  vital role in breaking the cycle of crime and creating a more just  and equitable society.
